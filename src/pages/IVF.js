                    <p>
                      In vitro fertilization (IVF) is a procedure used to treat
                      fertility problems and provide assistance with the
                      conception of a child. During in vitro fertilization,
                      mature eggs are retrieved from the ovaries of the woman
                      and fertilized by sperm in a lab. Then the fertilized egg
                      (embryo) or eggs are implanted in the uterus. One cycle of
                      in vitro fertilization takes about two to three weeks. In
                      vitro fertilization is the most effective form of assisted
                      reproductive technology (ART). The procedure can be done
                      using your own eggs and your partner's sperm, donor eggs,
                      donor sperm or donor embryos. In some cases, a gestational
                      surrogate - a woman who has your embryo implanted in her
                      uterus - might be used.
